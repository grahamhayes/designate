    Previous versions of eventlet changed the behaviour of socket.send() to
    match socket.sendall(). in eventlet 0.18.0 this changed and it reverted
    to the traditional behaviour.

    This caused the minidns service to misbehave in some circumstances.

    This fix reverts the tcp call to the correct sendall() method
issues:
  - The fix for minidns's issues TCP can cause minidns to fail to send some messages.
    This manifests itself with eventlet not being able to send all the data
    before socket is closed.
fixes:
  - Allows minidns to push large zone transfers over long range network connections
